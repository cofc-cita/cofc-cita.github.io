## What is the College of Charleston Cybersecurity Club?

College of Charleston’s Cybersecurity Club is a student-led, student-run organization within the Computer Science department that focuses on information security and privacy. We hope to fill gaps in the existing curriculum regarding computer networking and infosec, all while preparing members for real-world scenarios and allowing for sharing of experiences and local expertise.

## What We Do

Our club meets each week in order to develop our skills, knowledge and understanding of the many different aspects of security, ranging from simpler topics such as network enumeration and command-line functions to more complex topics such as systems administration, hashing, steganography, and firewall policy. We hope by covering a wide range of topics within the overall cybersecurity umbrella we can cultivate new skilled professionals who are experts in these fields.

## The Defense Team

An important part of our club is the Cyber Defense Team. The CofC Cyber Defense Team competes in several competitions each year including the [Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition](http://pcdc-sc.com/) (PCDC) and the [Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](https://cyberinstitute.kennesaw.edu/seccdc/index.php) (SECCDC). In 2021 our team placed 1st at SECCDC and became the first school from South Carolina to advance to the National CCDC where we placed 9th in the nation.  

Competing in these competitions provides extremely valuable experience that is recognized in the industry. Many past defense team members attribute job offers, interviews, or raises they have received directly to their participation in these competitions.

Anyone, regardless of experience, is encouraged to participate!
