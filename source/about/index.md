## What is the College of Charleston Cybersecurity Club?
College of Charlestonâ€™s Cybersecurity Club is a student-led, student-run group within the Computer Science department that focuses on information security and privacy. We hope to fill gaps in the existing curriculum regarding basic networking and infosec, all while preparing members for real-world scenarios and allowing for sharing of experiences and local expertise.

## What We Do / Meeting Schedule
Our club meets each week in order to develop our skills, knowledge and understanding of the many different aspects of security, ranging from simpler topics such as network enumeration and command-line functions to more complex topics such as systems administration, hashing, steganography, and firewall policy. We hope by covering a wide range of topics within the overall cybersecurity umbrella we can cultivate new skilled professionals who are experts in these fields.

## Schedule
Meetings are at 7:30 pm unless otherwise specified.
